### Setup

Unlike other challenge, this one need a bit of setup. 

Setupt the containers

```

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/
2. Setup admin account
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/bin/import/XWiki/XWikiPreferences
4. Import the `org.xwiki.platform_xwiki-platform-search-solr-ui_16.4.0.xar`.

We are installing only this extension because this enough, this comes pre installed in Standard flavour of XWiki, setting up that instance is time consuming. So we just installing the extension needed.
